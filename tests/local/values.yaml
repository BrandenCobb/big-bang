# This file is meant to be used to override the values file located at tests/ci/k3d/values.yaml
# to further decrease the cpu requests of some services so it fits on a standard quad core developer
# laptop. CPU allocation on a local machine is a little weird, but if you have something like
# an Intel i7 then you should hopefully see about '8000m' as the total available CPU in the k8s
# cluster. For memory if you don't have 32GB or more you're not gonna have a fun day. The last
# time this was looked at the total requests using this yaml and tests/ci/k3d/values.yaml were
# 7360m CPU and 23008Mi memory. Those number will probably change as things are developed, so
# don't take them at their word.

# Fair warning, your machine will likely be chugging hard to keep up.
