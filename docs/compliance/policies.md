### Requirements

#### No Root (p.7)

container engines allow containers to run applications as a
non-root user with non-root group membership. Typically, this non-default setting is
configured when the container image is built. Alternatively, Kubernetes can load containers into a Pod with
SecurityContext:runAsUser specifying a non-zero user. While the runAsUser
directive effectively forces non-root execution at deployment, NSA and CISA
encourage developers to build container applications to execute as a non-root user.
Having non-root execution integrated at build time provides better assurance that
applications will function correctly without root privileges. From: [Kubernetes Hardening Guide](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/03/2002820425/-1/-1/1/CTR_KUBERNETES%20HARDENING%20GUIDANCE.PDF)

How we check



#### Immutable Container Filesystem (p.8)

By default, containers are permitted mostly unrestricted execution within their own
context. A cyber actor who has gained execution in a container can create files,
download scripts, and modify the application within the container. Kubernetes can lock
down a containerâ€™s file system, thereby preventing many post-exploitation activities.
However, these limitations also affect legitimate container applications and can
potentially result in crashes or anomalous behavior. To prevent damaging legitimate
applications, Kubernetes administrators can mount secondary read/write file systems for
specific directories where applications require write access. From: [Kubernetes Hardening Guide](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/03/2002820425/-1/-1/1/CTR_KUBERNETES%20HARDENING%20GUIDANCE.PDF)

BigBang valides this at runtime with the Gatekeeper policy here: https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/main/chart/templates/constraints/readOnlyRoot.yaml

#### Secure Images (p.8)

Building secure container images
Container images are usually created by either building a container from scratch or by
building on top of an existing image pulled from a repository. In addition to using trusted
repositories to build containers, image scanning is key to ensuring deployed containers
are secure. Throughout the container build workflow, images should be scanned to
identify outdated libraries, known vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations, such as insecure
ports or permissions. From: [Kubernetes Hardening Guide](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/03/2002820425/-1/-1/1/CTR_KUBERNETES%20HARDENING%20GUIDANCE.PDF)

How we check: IronBank images are built with the best practices of the DoD and hardening guide. By
ensuring that the BigBang components deploy only IronBank images, as currently identified by their registry,
we're able to ensure that BigBang uses Secure Images. Future work will confirm this cryptographically.

#### Pod Security Policies (p.10)

[Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) were deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21 and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25.  Instead of implementing deprecated PSPs, Big Bang is using an external admission controller, OPA Gatekeeper, to enforce the policies listed in this section.

#### No Privileged Containers (p.10, table 1)

Controls whether Pods can run privileged Containers which have increased access to kernel calls.

BigBang validates this at runtime with the Gatekeeper policy here: https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/main/chart/templates/constraints/noPrivilegedContainers.yaml
