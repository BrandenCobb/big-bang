# BigBang Licensing Expectations
While BigBang's itself is open source and free to use, the same cannot be said of it's components. The licensing requirements of components requires a nuanced explanation. The intent of this document is to be a self service resource to help to help consumers of BigBang make an informed decision about what licenses they may need to look into to successfully implement BigBang.


## What Licenses do I need for BigBang?
There are 2 issues that make it difficult to figure out BigBang's license requirements:
1. The modular (and in some cases swappable) componentized nature of BigBang means choices affect license requirements. OS, Kubernetes Distribution, and Application decisions need to be made before license requirements can be sorted out.
2. Freemium applications often require a license to unlock features like HA (High Availability), Advanced SSO functionality with authn, authz, and audit logging of federated users. Advanced compliance controls like FIPS 140-2 mode, compliance reporting, or audit logs.


## What components could have licenses?
1. OS / CSP(Cloud Service Providers) VM Images
  * RHEL requires a license and comes with Vendor Support
  * CSPs often offer licensed VM Images at additional per hour cost, these add features like offloading STIG/CIS OS hardening
  * There are free OS options like CentOS / Ubuntu and tools like [openscap](https://www.open-scap.org/), which has ansible and bash scripts to automate STIG/CIS benchmark compliance for OS security to help automate DIY hardening.
2. Kubernetes Distributions
  * RH OpenShift, VMware TKG, D2IQ Konvoy each require a license, that comes with support and additional features, they each offer 30-90 day trial licenses
  * There are free options like kubeadm, k3s, k0s, and RKE2
  * RKE2 is a free option that can be licensed for Vendor Support
3. BigBang's Core Applications:
  * Many of the core applications are free open source software
  * Twistlock is a core component that requires a license
  * ElasticSearch is a core component that requires a license to unlock additional features, that could be considered required in some cases (more on this nuance below.)
4. BigBang's AddOn Applications:
  * Also include a mix of free, freemium, and licensed products.


## Who purchases the licenses?
Licensing of products deployable by BigBang are not covered by the BigBang team. As a general rule of thumb the acquisition of licenses are the responsibility of the end-using organization, and the product vendors should be reached out for support. (Exceptions to the rule involve PartyBus and Tier 1 Customers.) 
DRAFT_NOTE: (Ask a member of P1 Customer Success to validate this during a peer review and then get rid of this note.)


## Who decides if a licenced feature in a freemium application is a hard requirement?
* The Consumer of BigBang, their security team, and AO (Authorizing official) need to decide if licensed features constitute a hard requirement or if free tier functionality can be considered at lower impact levels or unique use cases.
* In most cases licenses will be required due to Security Controls only being available in the fully licensed version; however, users may be able to hold off on licensed versions for proof of concepts and while integration of applications are figured out before being used in a production capacity.
* Even if there isn't a hard requirement for a license, consumers of BigBang may still want to consider purchasing licenses or support contracts. Big Bang does not provide support for any the components themselves, just the initial deployment and integration of the components. This means that your operations staff are responsible for day-to-day maintenance of all of the underlying software products, as well as any OS and Kubernetes Distribution updates that need to be applied. Licensing and Vendor support contracts can help with this.
