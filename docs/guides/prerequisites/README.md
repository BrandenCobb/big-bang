# Prerequisites:
* How the Prerequisites docs are organized:
  * This README.md is meant to be a high level overview of prerequsites.
  * /docs/guides/prerequsites/(some_topic).md files are meant to offer more specific guidance on prerequisites while staying generic. 
  * The /docs/guides/deployment_scenarios/(some_topic).md files may also offer additional details on prerequesites specific to the scenario. 
* Prerequisites vary depending on deployment scenario, thus a table is used to give an overview.
* Note for future edits: The following table was generated using tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables, recommended to copy the table's raw text contents, visit tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables, and File -> Paste table data when edits are needed.
