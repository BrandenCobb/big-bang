# New Big Bang Packages

This is the process for adding a new package into Big Bang

## Out-of-Tree / 3rd Party Packages

### Submit New Big Bang Package Proposal to the BB Technical Oversite Committee

[BB TOC New Package Proposal](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=)

A shepherd will be assigned to the project to create a repo in the [BB sandbox](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/sandbox)

### Process

Out-of-Tree packages packages will follow the [BBTOC process](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/bbtoc/-/tree/master/process) from Sandbox -> Incubating -> Graduated

## In-Tree / Big Bang Maintained Package Process

In order for a package to become an "In-Tree" package (supported by Platform One), it must meet all of the requirements of a BB TOC graduated package and have an [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/groups/platform-one/big-bang/apps/third-party/-/issues) opened to 'Recommend Package for "In-Tree" Support'. The issue will be processed through the Platform One Jedi Order and Rebel Alliance councils for a governement decision to be added as officially supported / "in-tree" add-on.
