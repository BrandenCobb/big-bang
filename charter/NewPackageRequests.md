# New Big Bang Packages

This is the process for adding an package into Big Bang

## Submit New BB Package Proposal to DSOP Technical Oversite Committee

https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=

A shepherd will be assigned to the project to create a repo in the BB sandbox https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/sandbox

## Incubation

To get into an incubation stage, an package needs the following:

* Written support by **two** Big Bang Customers identifying capability gap in BigBang
* Nomination of **two** developers from different companies, who have contributed to other big bang packages, as Package Owners.
* Architecture Review approved by a majority of the present Big Bang Package Owners.
* Containers hosted in Iron Bank, or the vendor has submitted containers to Iron Bank and processing / approval is pending.
* Sign-off by Government

## Graduated

To become a graduate package, a package needs the following:

* Documented community suppport for the package
* Assigned & active repo maintainers 
* Validation thhe package adheres to all [Package Requirements](Package Requirements.md)
* The appropriate containers for the package are hosted in Iron Bank. 

Once this criteria has been met, a final review of implementation details will be presented to the Big Bang Admins for inclusion as a community-maintained, "out-of-tree" package.

## In-Tree / Big Bang Maintained Package Process

In order for a package to become an "in-tree" Big Bang-maintained package, it must go through Jedi Order and Rebel Alliance for a governement decision on adding it as officially as an "in-tree", supported add-on.
